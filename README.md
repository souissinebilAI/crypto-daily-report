# Crypto Daily Report

An automated daily review of the crypto market. Every morning at about 09:00 (Berlin time) a
GitHub Actions workflow fetches prices from the public [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api),
writes a Markdown report with a 7-day chart, appends the numbers to a CSV history and updates this page.

The commits labelled `chore(bot): daily market report` are made by that workflow, not by hand.

## Latest report

<!-- LATEST:START -->
*The first report appears here after the workflow's first run.*
<!-- LATEST:END -->

## How it works

**Trigger:** a scheduled workflow ([`.github/workflows/daily-report.yml`](.github/workflows/daily-report.yml))
starts at 07:00 and 08:00 UTC. A gate step only lets the run continue from 09:00 Berlin time, which
keeps the time right in both summer and winter. It can also be started by hand under *Actions → Run workflow*.

**Inputs:** current prices, 24h and 7-day changes and 7-day price curves for Bitcoin, Ethereum,
Solana, BNB, XRP, Cardano and Dogecoin in EUR, plus total market data.

**What happens:** the unit tests run first. Then [`report.py`](report.py) (Python standard library
only) fetches the data, builds the summary and table and draws the chart as an SVG. A second run
on the same day does nothing.

**Outputs:**

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `reports/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | the day's report |
| `charts/YYYY-MM-DD.svg` | 7-day performance, each coin indexed to 100 |
| `data/history.csv` | one row per coin per day, for later analysis |
| `README.md` | the latest report section above |

## Run it locally

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
python report.py          # FORCE=1 python report.py to rebuild today's report
```

An optional free CoinGecko demo key can be added as the repository secret `COINGECKO_API_KEY`
if the public API starts rate-limiting the runner.
